Data Analytics Project: Impact of MINUSMA Departure on Violence Against Civilians in Mali


Objective
- To analyze the effect of the UN Peacekeeping force MINUSMA's departure on violence against civilians in Mali, considering the impact of political events such as the coup d’état and the arrival of Wagner mercenaries.
Research Question
- How has the departure of MINUSMA affected the overall protective environment and violence against civilians in Mali?

Deliverables
-Tableau dashboard will include a timeline chart displaying key events like the departure of MINUSMA, the coup d’état, and the arrival of Wagner mercenaries, along with a heatmap showing the geographic distribution of violence against civilians over time. It will also feature trend lines illustrating changes in violence type (if any), a bar chart comparing incidents before and after MINUSMA’s departure, and a pie chart breaking down types of violence.

Resources
-	Conflict Data: ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project),
-	Political Events: News reports and official announcements, information on Wagner mercenaries from international NGOs and news agencies
-	UN Peacekeeping Data: UN reports on MINUSMA operations and departure

Project steps
1.	Data Sources Identification
o	Conflict Data: ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project), UCDP (Uppsala Conflict Data Program)
o	Political Events: News reports and official announcements, information on Wagner mercenaries from international NGOs and news agencies
o	UN Peacekeeping Data: UN reports on MINUSMA operations and departure

2.	Data Sources Identification, Collection and Preparation
o	Extract relevant data on violence against civilians in Mali from ACLED via either API or csv download. Possible also through direct server connection. Not sure what is easier yet. 
o	Collate political relevant dates as highlights such as mandate vote, mission closure, information on the coup d’état and Wagner mercenaries' arrival etc.
o	Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. Address missing values and outliers.
o	Integrate all data sources into a single dataset, including conflict events, political developments, and MINUSMA's timeline.

3.	Analysis Approach
o	Descriptive Analysis: Calculate the frequency and types of violence against civilians over time. Identify broad trends and patterns before and after the departure of MINUSMA.
o	Comparative Analysis: Compare the periods before and after MINUSMA's departure to identify significant changes.
o	Correlation Analysis: Examine the correlation between MINUSMA's departure, the coup d’état, the arrival of Wagner mercenaries, and changes in violence patterns.
o	Identify main conflict actors: JNIM, MDSF, Wagner…

4.	Visualization in Tableau
o	Timeline Chart: Display key events such as the departure of MINUSMA, the coup d’état, and the arrival of Wagner mercenaries.
o	Heatmap: Show the geographic distribution of violence against civilians in Mali over time. Southwards trend?
o	Trend Lines: Illustrate trends in violence against civilians, highlighting periods of significant change.
o	Bar Chart: Compare the number of incidents involving civilians before and after MINUSMA’s departure.
o	Pie Chart: Breakdown of types of violence (e.g., abductions, killings, assaults, SGBV) over different periods.

5.	Dashboard Layout
o	Header: “Impact of MINUSMA Departure on Violence Against Civilians in Mali”
o	Timeline Chart: At the top, showing key events.
o	Heatmap: Below the timeline, showing the distribution of violence incidents.
o	Trend Lines and Bar Charts: Side by side, illustrating changes over time and before/after comparison.
o	 Otherinteresting elements such as actors change of vilence type or quality over time etc. 


o	Pie Chart: At the bottom, providing a breakdown of violence types.
o	Bar chart: main actors.  
7.	Expected Outcomes
o	Insightful visualizations that highlight changes in violence against civilians since mission departure.
